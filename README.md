# USDZ

USDZ is a project to launch a stablecoin pegged to Zac Prince's lost wager to AmericanHODL of 1 BTC/USD.  In a world of stablecoins with questionable assets, leveraged liabilities, and unaudited accounting, the assured expectation of Zac's debt going unpaid creates a pristine asset by way of pegging BTC to USD. 1 USDZ = USD market-price of 1 BTC.

Immediate implementation in exchanges would look like the following:

Many characteristics are still undefined but the following constitutes a first set of choices:

  * Introduction of Proof of Worked-Over consensus mechanism.
  * Implementation of ZAC-rollups to commit transactions without proof of future settlement.
  * Introduce 5% yield automatically distributed to genesis wallet address.
  * 2nd layer "McCormack McNetwork" to shield transactions and liquidate USDZ to USD prior to any network collapse.
  * Only foreseeable vulnerability would be Zac's fulfillment of bet obligation.

## Status

USDZ is still under development. Much is left to be done and [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome (see below).
